# Multivariate Analysis of Manufacturing Process Data


### Overview 

This project applies clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques to manufacturing process data. 

The goal is to group similar product types and reduce complexity in high-dimensional datasets, making it easier to uncover structure in the production process. 

This repository is part of my Applies Statistics Thesis Project.
